        My name is Josh Holland. I am a computer aided design drafter
        for an engineering firm in Tualatin Oregon. During my free time,
        I am teaching myself computer programming and I am very exited
        about my future as a software developer!
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I am new to computer programming, I feel that my 3 years of
        Mechanical design experience in the circuit board industry have prepared
        me for this journey. As a designer, I am practicing critical thinking
        and creative problem solving skills every single day. From what I hear,
        developers don't just need to write code, they need to be problem solvers
        above anything else.

        Feel free to explore my website and don't hesitate to contact me if
        you wish to speak with me regarding a job opportunity.
    </p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
